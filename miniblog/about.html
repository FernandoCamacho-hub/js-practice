            Fer, fullname Salvador Fernando Camacho Hernandez, but he prefers Fer. Salvador makes him feel like his father and there
            are some complications on that front. But anyway, I have two siblings, an older sister and a younger brother. I am 21 years old, I actually turn 21 7 days ago. 
            I have many interests. I love sports like football, that's the English and all the world football and not the american variety.
            I also love to swim. I started swimming when I was about 5 years and really enjoy it, it is relaxing and I actually have great
            thinking sessions while swimming, like a very wet walk.
            Other interests I have are reading epic fantasy and reading in general but fantasy is my jam. I try to write stories, but it 
            complicated. I love to play videogames, like Hades - my favorite game of all time - Hollow Knight, Elden Ring, God of War, The Last 
            of Us, Spider-Man, etc, etc.
            And obviously I love coding and the sciences, math, physics. They scratch something in my head, and if the conditions are the right 
            ones I could be solving problems for hours.
